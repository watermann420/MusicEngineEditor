# Contributing to MusicEngineEditor
## Idea Ownership & Code Assignment Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **MusicEngineEditor**.  
MusicEngineEditor is built on creativity, experimentation, and collaboration.

To keep the project legally clear while respecting contributors,  
the following rules apply to **all contributions**.

By contributing, you agree to this agreement.

---

## 1. Ideas & Concepts

All **ideas, concepts, suggestions, feature proposals, and discussions**  
(shared via issues, discussions, chats, or comments):

- remain the intellectual property of the contributor,  
- are **not automatically owned** by MusicEngineEditor,  
- may be reused by the contributor in other projects.

Submitting an idea alone does **not** transfer ownership.

---

## 2. Code & Implementations

All **code and technical implementations** that are:

- submitted as pull requests,  
- committed to this repository,  
- merged into MusicEngineEditor,  

become the **exclusive property of MusicEngineEditor**.

This includes:

- source code  
- scripts  
- editor modules  
- internal tools  
- documentation directly tied to code behavior  

By submitting code, you **assign all copyrights** of that code to MusicEngineEditor.

---

## 3. Separation of Idea and Code

An idea does **not** become owned by MusicEngineEditor until it is:

- implemented in code, **and**  
- submitted to this repository.

Only the **actual written code** is assigned —  
the underlying idea remains yours.

---

## 4. Moral Rights & Modification

Where applicable by law, contributors agree to:

- waive or not assert moral rights related to contributed code,  
- allow MusicEngineEditor to modify, rewrite, relicense, or restructure the code  
  without restriction.

---

## 5. License Back to Contributors

Unless explicitly stated, contributors do **not** receive an automatic license  
to reuse contributed code outside of MusicEngineEditor.

Reuse requires explicit permission from the MusicEngineEditor maintainer.

---

## 6. Project Control & Future

MusicEngineEditor retains full control over:

- project direction,  
- licensing and relicensing,  
- commercial and non-commercial use,  
- future foundation, organization, or company structures.

This applies regardless of project size or success.

---

## 7. Community & Opportunities

MusicEngineEditor values contributors who are:

- respectful,  
- kind,  
- creative,  
- collaborative.

If the project grows, contributors who wish to may:

- be publicly credited,  
- be invited into closer collaboration,  
- be considered for paid roles or positions.

No obligation, no guarantee.

---

## 8. Contributor Declaration

- you have the legal right to submit ideas and/or code,  
- any submitted code is your own work,

---

## 9. Acceptance

Submitting ideas, code, pull requests, or commits  
constitutes acceptance of this agreement.
